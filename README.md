# 🦜 Parrot Project 

Welcome to the **Parrot Project** repository! This project contains scripts and data for the analysis of parrot microbiome samples, focusing on data processing, diversity analysis, and predictive modeling.

We are trying to see if we can identify parrots who have been smuggled from the wild into captivity 🏴‍☠️

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders and scripts corresponding to each stage of the analysis:

- **Folders 1–6**: Contain outputs and intermediate files generated by the scripts below.

## 📝 Scripts Overview (all in the MelissaAnalysis folder)

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Process & Clean Data** | Processes and cleans input data |
| **2. Combine & Split Inputs** | Combines and splits up input datasets |
| **3. Alpha Diversity** | Analyzes alpha diversity between groups |
| **4. Beta Diversity** | Analyzes beta diversity between groups |
| **5. Taxa Driving Group Differences** | Identifies taxa/features driving group differences |
| **6. Group Prediction Models** | Builds models to classify parrots into groups and assesses their accuracy |
